## Features

Due to time constraints again, we focused on representing the core pages as closely to our figma mockup as possible. We unforuntately did not have time to implement the following features, however, given more time we would include these in our website:

### Core Features

1. Feed
2. Gallery View
3. Profile editing
4. Notifications
5. Gallery Creation
6. Sign Up Page

### Missing Features

1. Search bar: Would allow users to search for both users, galleries and art pieces.
2. Gallery creation from likes: Similar to the gallery upload page except liked art pieces would be selectable.
3. Premiering events: Additional feature when creating a gallery with other users to premiere a gallery release as an internal event on the platform at a later date.
4. Notifications calendar: More interaction would be available in the form of users clicking dates on the calendar to see all corresponding events in the Notifications page.
5. Viewing other artists' profiles: Similar to the Profile editing page except you view another user's profile and cannot edit anything.
