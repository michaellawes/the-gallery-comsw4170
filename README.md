### Core Features

1. Feed 
2. Gallery View
3. Profile editing
4. Notifications
5. Gallery Creation
6. Sign Up Page

## Features

Due to time constraints again, we focused on representing the core pages as closely to our figma mockup as possible. We unforuntately did not have time to implement all the features, however, given more time we would include these in our website:

### Missing Features

1. Search bar: Would allow users to search for other users, galleries and art pieces on the platform.
2. Gallery creation from likes: Where a user would be able to create a gallery from art pieces they have already liked. Similar to the gallery upload page except liked art pieces would be selectable.
3. Premiering events: Additional feature when creating a gallery with other users to premiere a gallery release as an internal event on the platform at a later date.
4. Notifications calendar: Would allow for interactions from users to be able to click on a date and see the corresponding event in the Notification page.
5. Viewing other artists' profiles: Similar to the Profile editing page except you are able to view another user's profile but cannot edit on their page. 

## Credit

Due to time constraints on completing the website implementation we used Material-UI Icons for the icons inside the application.
